Quickstart
-------
Migrate the db

````
$ rake db:migrate
````

Make sure that the tests pass

````
$ rake test
````


Jump in console and give the basic simulation a shot.

````ruby
$ rails c
:001 > x = World.new.robot
:002 > x.move(100)
:003 > x.move(0,120)
:004 > x.move(1000)
````
You should end up with a bump reading at N:90, X:126 Y:89
The "Y" might vary due to incremental error, just like in real life. :)
X:126 is the center point of Simulated Roomba. Add the radius of Roomba + the radius of the obstacle and it should be the same as the distance between X:126 and the default simulated obstacle.

Or jump into the rails app and play around.

rails s
